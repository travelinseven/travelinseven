> My hourly rate is $125.00 (US) per hour, rounded up to the nearest quarter hour. If you know what you want, and the scope of your project is strictly defined, I might be able to quote you a flat rate for the job. I'm also open to discounted monthly retainer agreements (essentially prepaid hours to use within that month). You'll get a discount off of my hourly rate and I'll make sure I'm available to provide those hours within the month. Retainer agreements start at $3,000.00 (US) per month.
